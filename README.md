#  AI-Based Rock Paper Scissors
Created an AI-based Rock Paper Scissors game that adapts to player behavior using ML.
An **intelligent Rock–Paper–Scissors game** that doesn’t play randomly.  
This AI **learns from the player’s behavior**, detects patterns, and adapts its strategy using **Machine Learning concepts** like frequency analysis and Markov Chains.

> 🧠 After a few rounds, the AI starts predicting your next move!

## 🎯 Project Objective

Traditional Rock–Paper–Scissors games rely on randomness.  
This project introduces **adaptive intelligence**, where the system:

- Observes player choices
- Learns decision patterns
- Predicts future moves
- Counters strategically

The goal is to demonstrate **practical ML concepts in a fun, interactive way**, using only frontend technologies.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Adaptive AI Engine
- Learns from your last **5–10 moves**
- Adjusts strategy dynamically
- Becomes harder as you keep playing

### 📊 Real-Time Game Statistics
- Your Wins
- AI Wins
- Ties
- AI Win Rate (%)

### 📜 Recent Match History
- Displays last rounds with:
  - Player move
  - AI move
  - Result (Win / Loss / Tie)

### 🎮 Interactive UI
- Smooth animations
- Modern card-based layout
- Fully responsive design

### 🔁 Reset & Retrain
- Reset the game anytime
- AI retrains from scratch

## 🧩 How the AI Works

The intelligence is **rule-based ML logic**, inspired by real machine learning strategies:

- **Pattern Analysis**  
  Tracks sequences in recent player moves

- **Frequency Learning**  
  Calculates probability distribution of player choices

- **Markov Chain Logic**  
  Predicts the next move based on transition patterns

- **Adaptive Strategy**  
  Counters predicted moves with ~70% confidence

- **Anti-Exploitation**  
  Adds ~30% randomness so the AI doesn’t become predictable

- **Training Phase**  
  Requires **5+ games** before predictions activate

> This balance ensures the AI feels smart but still fair.

## 🧪 Example Gameplay Flow

1. Player selects Rock / Paper / Scissors
2. AI responds (initially random)
3. System records player behavior
4. After training phase:
   - AI predicts next move
   - Counters intelligently
5. Statistics & history update live
